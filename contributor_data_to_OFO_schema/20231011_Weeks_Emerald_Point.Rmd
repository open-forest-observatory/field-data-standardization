Load data

Calculate the area and centroid of the main plot polygon

```{r}
# First project to a projected (meters) coordinate system with equal x and y distances, CONUS Albers Equal Area (EPSG: 5070) 

plotpolygon = st_transform(plotpolygon, crs = 5070)

st_area (plotpolygon)

plotpolygon$area_meters <- 0

plotpolygon$area_meters = st_area (plotpolygon)

# Convert back to 4326

plotpolygon = st_transform(plotpolygon, crs = 4326)

#### Calculate centroid of each polygon ####

plotpolygon$centroid <- 0

Export subplot names and geometry to a csv

```{r}
# extract the geometry features into columns of lat and long, then merge back into the spatial data frame

#Export

write.csv(subplotscoords, "C:\\Users\\emily\\Box\\FOCAL\\field-data-standardization\\Weeks.EmeraldPoint\\20231012_WeeksEmeraldPoint_subplots.csv")

Add OFO plot ID and subplot IDs

```{r}

# plot ID

trees <- trees %>%

trees = full_join(trees, st_drop_geometry(subplots_merge), by='Plot_Loc')

```

Add tree lat and lon

```{r}

# add a tree id column 

trees <- trees %>%
  add_column(tree_id_ofo = "")

# extract the geometry features into columns of lat and long, then merge back into the spatial data frame

Units of height, dbh, height to crown, crown width (x2)

Calculate distance to pith

```{r}

Get rid of NAs

```{r}

# decay class

trees$Decay_class[is.na(trees$Decay_class)] <- ""
trees$Decay_class[trees$Decay_class == 'NA'] <- ''

```


Exclude duplicate trees and columns that are just NAs

```{r}

# exclude rows full of NAs

trees <- trees %>% drop_na (Plot)

# exclude duplicates

trees <- trees[trees$duplicated == FALSE, ] 

```

Exclude trees outside plot boundary

```{r}

trees_inside <- st_intersection(trees, plotpolygon)

# also confirmed this result in qGIS!

```

Just a note that azimuth_corrected is the column we want to use here! Has declination applied :)

Export to csv

```{r}
#Export

write.csv(st_drop_geometry(trees_inside), "C:\\Users\\emily\\Box\\FOCAL\\field-data-standardization\\Weeks.EmeraldPoint\\20231012_WeeksEmeraldPoint_treesprocessed.csv")
```


# CORRECTIONS MADE IN EXCEL

Manually dragged some damage codes that were hiding in the "remarks" section to the damage code columns
