## DATA MANIPULATED IN R

```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Load libraries

library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(stringr)
```

Load data

```{r}

# Set working directory

setwd("C:\\Users\\emily\\Box\\FOCAL\\ofo-field-data")

# Load data
trees <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\emily\\Box\\FOCAL\\ofo-field-data\\1_received-data\\0008\\data\\SJFDP_Census_4ha_full_202230427.csv")

subplots <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\emily\\Box\\FOCAL\\ofo-field-data\\1_received-data\\0008\\data\\SJFDP_Env_4ha_20230504.csv")

```

We want to eliminate shrubs and any stems that aren't main stems

```{r}

# Only keep main stems

trees <- subset(trees, Main!="S")

# Get rid of shrubs

trees <- subset(trees, Code!="ARCGLA" & Code!="ARCPRI" & Code!="ARCPUN" & Code!="CEAPAL" & Code!="FRACAL" & Code!="LONSUB" & Code!="RHOOCC")

```

Calculate plot centroid

```{r}

# x coordinate centroid is the 16s

# y coordinate centroid is the Fs

# therefore F16 is the centroid of the whole plot

```

Add OFO plot ID and subplot IDs

OH NO PROBLEMS:
- some plants were shot from quadrat corners outside the grid (e.g. the Ks and the 21s)
- some plants were measured from along the grid line with a tape measure (e.g. not shot from a quadrat corner)

LOOKS LIKE THESE ARE PROBLEMS FOR LATER

```{r}

# plot ID

trees <- trees %>%
  add_column(plot_id_ofo = "0081")

# subplot ID

trees <- trees %>%
  add_column(subplot_id_ofo = "0")

# going to add subplot ID to the subplot datasheet and then merge it into the tree datasheet

# add column

subplots <- subplots %>%
  add_column(subplot_id_ofo = "0")

# sort in descending order

subplots <- arrange(subplots, Quad)

# remove subplots not used for our purposes here

# first the 21s

subplots <- subset(subplots, Quad!="A21" & Quad!="B21" & Quad!="C21" & Quad!="D21" & Quad!="E21" & Quad!="F21" & Quad!="G21" & Quad!="H21" & Quad!="I21" & Quad!="J21")

# then the Ks

subplots <- subset(subplots, Quad!="K11" & Quad!="K12" & Quad!="K13" & Quad!="K14" & Quad!="K15" & Quad!="K16" & Quad!="K17" & Quad!="K18" & Quad!="K19" & Quad!="K20" & Quad!="K21")

# add subplot ID numbers to each quadrat

for(i in 1:nrow(subplots)) {
subplots$subplot_id_ofo[i] <- i + 211
}

# change some column names and get rid of some columsn in the subplot data sheet to prepare to merge it into the tree data sheet

subplots <- subset(subplots, select = c(Quad, Lat, Long, subplot_id_ofo))

subplots <- subplots %>% rename("QuadLat" = "Lat") %>% rename("QuadLong" = "Long") 

# !!!!we're going to assign trees to subplots based on which quadrat corner they were measured from, NOT which quadrat they are in!!!!

# change the name of the "RF_Grid_Corner"	(The grid pole that the rangefinder was shot from) column to "Quad"

trees <- trees %>% 
       rename("Quad" = "RF_Grid_Corner")

```

Tree lat and tree lon

```{r}

```


Tree DBH is in cm :)

Tree species

```{r}

# putting FIA species codes in the pre-existing "Code" column, which I'm renaming to "Species Code"

trees$Code[trees$Code == 'ABICON'] <- '015'
trees$Code[trees$Code == 'CALDEC'] <- '081'
trees$Code[trees$Code == 'PINLAM'] <- '117'
trees$Code[trees$Code == 'PINPON'] <- '122'
trees$Code[trees$Code == 'PINJEF'] <- '116'
trees$Code[trees$Code == 'QUEKEL'] <- '818'
trees$Code[trees$Code == 'UNKN'] <- '000'

trees$Code[trees$Code == 'QUEWIS'] <- '839'
trees$Code[trees$Code == 'QUECHR'] <- '805'
trees$Code[trees$Code == 'PINCOU'] <- '109'
trees$Code[trees$Code == 'QUEXMO'] <- '800' # the Quercus x moreha (Q. kelloggii x wislizeni) is being labelled as Quercus spp.


trees <- trees %>% 
       rename("SpeciesCode" = "Code")
```

Status Live/Dead

```{r}

# codes to L and D

trees$Status[trees$Status == 'DS'] <- 'D'
trees$Status[trees$Status == 'LI'] <- 'L'

# remove trees that are dead and down

trees <- subset(trees, Status!="Dt")
```

Damage codes

BB	Bark beetle
CD	Crown >75% damaged
FS	Fire scar
L	Leaning > 30 degrees
MS	Mistletoe
PD	Pest damage
SBAD	Stem broken above DBH
T	Topped

```{r}

trees$Codes <- str_replace(trees$Codes, "BB", "11000")
trees$Codes <- str_replace(trees$Codes, "CD", "90000") # unclear what kind of crown damage this is referring to (biotic or abiotic, mechanical damage, flagging...it's a mystery) so I'm labelling this as "other damages"
trees$Codes <- str_replace(trees$Codes, "FS", "30000")
trees$Codes <- str_replace(trees$Codes, "L", "90006")
trees$Codes <- str_replace(trees$Codes, "MS", "23000") # general code for parisitic/epiphytic plants, there are so many mistletoes 
trees$Codes <- str_replace(trees$Codes, "PD", "10000") # general code for insect damage
trees$Codes <- str_replace(trees$Codes, "SBAD", "90001")
trees$Codes <- str_replace(trees$Codes, "T", "60001")

```

Distance to pith from wherever the tree was shot from

```{r}

# add a new column for horizontal distance to pith

trees <- trees %>%
  add_column(horiz_distance_pith = "")

# calculate

trees$horiz_distance_pith = trees$HD + (0.5 * 0.01 * trees$DBH)

# get rid of NAs-- only the trees measured with distance/azimuth from a quadrat corner will have this measurement

trees$horiz_distance_pith[is.na(trees$horiz_distance_pith)] <- ""

```






## ALTERATIONS MADE IN EXCEL

Manually separated damage codes into damage code columns
